## Key Technologies

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **React Navigation**: Screen navigation
- **React Native Paper**: Material Design components
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Recipe generation
- **Google Gemini Flash 2.5**: Image analysis for ingredient detection
- **React Native Image Picker**: Camera and gallery access
- **React Native Markdown Display**: Recipe formatting

## API Configuration

The app uses two AI services:

1. **Image Analysis** (Google Gemini Flash 2.5): Analyzes photos to detect ingredients and quantities
2. **Recipe Generation** (OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini): Creates recipes in real-time with streaming responses

### Supported Models

- **Gemini**: Uses `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for fast and accurate image analysis
- **OpenAI**: Uses `gpt-4.1-mini` for fast, creative recipe generation with real-time streaming

### Multi-Image Analysis

- **1-3 Photos**: Analyze multiple angles of your fridge/pantry in one go
- **Smart Combining**: AI automatically combines ingredients from all photos
- **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically merges quantities of the same ingredients
- **Optimized Processing**: All images processed together for better context

### Real-time Recipe Streaming

- **Live Generation**: Watch your recipe appear in real-time as AI writes it
- **No More Waiting**: See content immediately instead of waiting for completion
- **Interactive Experience**: Visual feedback during recipe creation
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses streaming to reduce perceived loading time

### Image Format Support

The app automatically detects and supports various image formats:
- **JPEG/JPG**: Standard format from most cameras
- **PNG**: High quality images with transparency
- **WebP**: Modern efficient format
- **HEIC/HEIF**: Apple's newer format from iPhones
- **GIF, BMP, TIFF**: Additional common formats

Make sure you have:
- Valid API keys for both services
- Sufficient API credits/quota
- Internet connectivity for API calls

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **Camera**: To take photos of ingredients
- **Photo Library**: To select existing photos

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
2. **iOS build errors**: Clean build folder in Xcode or run `cd ios && xcodebuild clean`
3. **Android build errors**: Clean gradle with `cd android && ./gradlew clean`

### API Errors

- Check your OpenAI and Gemini API keys are valid
- Ensure you have API credits/quota for both services
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check API service status if calls are failing
